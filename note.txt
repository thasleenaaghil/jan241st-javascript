JavaScript
----------
JavaScript can be used in both frontend(behaviour) as well as backend(it used to do logical operations)
js is compile using code
extension - .js
display - console.log()-used to display content
its a single thread programming language - line by line execution
dynamically typed language - datatype change - drawback-not good
cd-change directory
output - ctrl + j

data type
----------
1) string - single quotes or double quotes
2)Boolean - true or false
3)number - every number is considered as number(integer,float)

Method to check datatype - typeof()

concatenation - to join/add same or different data type
-------------
string+string = string
string + number = string
number + number = number

variables
---------
- used to store data
- identifiers - set of rules to  create variables
  1) start with letter , dollar ,underscore - prefer letter
  2) subsequent characters can be letters , digits , underscore etc......
  3) if there is more than one word - 
              - second word can be started with capital letter
              - use underscore b/w the words
              - no space b/w the words

 to  create variable - variableName = value
                    - keyword variableName = value

keyword - set of reserved words which gives a spl meaning to variables
        - cannot be used as variableName function name,........etc
1) const - its value doesnot changes(reassigning of variables not possible) - hoisting is not possible
2) var - value changes throughout - reassigning possible.hoisting is possible - functional level or global
3) let - reassigning possible - accessible inside a block{} - hoisting is not possible

hoisting - using of variables before it is declared/create

template literals
---------------------
- its a way of displaying content.  
`content ${variable}`(back tick is used)
